    "## Introduction\n",
    "    \n",
    "The AIF project, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/filippo-baglini/aif-project), aims to develop an intelligent agent for the MiniGrid environment, a highly customizable discrete-action environment within the Gymnasium library. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gymnasium is a Python framework designed for creating and testing simulated environments for reinforcement learning, offering a variety of pre-made scenarios for developing and benchmarking AI algorithms. MiniGrid, one of these environments, features a grid-based layout where the agent, represented as a triangle, interacts with objects like doors, keys, and boxes to navigate various challenges. \n",
    "Its high degree of configurability makes it an ideal platform for AI experimentation and customization.\n",

    "We compared the performance of our agent versus BabyAI in resolving the enviroments provided by the Minigrid. The metric we used for the comparison is the \"step\" and we tested in 100 different seeds the performance of both. In particular, every seed changes the objects position and the agent spawn position but keeps the same goal.\n",
