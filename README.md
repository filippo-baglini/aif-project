## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
The goal of this project is to design a personal AI capable of interacting with the MiniGrid environment, a sandbox specifically designed to develop and evaluate agents in grid-world tasks with minimal complexity. Our utility-based model agent, implementing fundamental AI algorithms, is tailored to solve all BabyAI environments efficiently.

## ðŸ›  Features
### Custom AI Agent:
Purpose-built for BabyAI environments with a focus on efficiency of steps.
Utilizes the A* search and Online Planning as the main algorithm for decision-making.
### Adaptability:
While designed for BabyAI, the AI can be extended for more complex MiniGrid environments with modifications to the mission parsing method.
### Performance:
Achieves a 99.8% win rate across 9,200 levels, surpassing the default BabyAI bot from the Farama Foundation library, which has a win rate of 99.47%. Additionally, our approach completes levels using fewer steps, demonstrating superior efficiency.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Installation
Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/filippo-baglini/aif-project.git
cd aif-project
```

Install Dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the AI:
```bash
python3 tests/OurBot_test
```

## ðŸŽ¥ Simulation

This GIF showcases our bot solving a challenging level where it must navigate a path filled with obstacles to drop an item beside another specific object.
